The <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">boys</character></character></character> squatted down on the bank, then lay on <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">their</character></character></character><object class="bodypart" type="male,child"> stomachs</object> and pushed <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">their</character></character></character> heads out like <object class="nature" type="animal" keywords="turtle">turtles</object>, trying to see. There was <character reg="Willens"><object class="bodypart" type="male" keywords="death,animal">something dark and furry</object></character>, <character reg="Willens"><object class="bodypart" type="male" keywords="death,animal">something like a big animal tail</object></character>, pushed up through the <object reg="WillensCar" type="part"><object class="window" type="open,sunroof">hole in the roof</object></object> and moving idly in the <object class="water" type="pond" keywords="death,hidden,evidence,secret">water</object>.

It seemed that inside the <object reg="WillensCar">car</object> a <object class="body" type="male,dead" keywords="evidence,hidden"><character reg="Willens">man's body</character></object>--it had to be the <object class="body" type="male,dead" keywords="evidence,hidden">body</object> of <character reg="Willens">Mr. Willens</character>--had got into a peculiar position.

The <object class="window" type="open">window</object> in fact must have been open and the <object class="bodypart" type="male">head</object> sticking out for the <object class="body" type="male,dead">body</object> to be lodged in that position.

This was a <object class="bodypart" type="male">face</object> already grotesque to <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">them</character></character></character>, in the way that many <object class="bodypart" type="male,female">adult faces</object> were, and <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">they</character></character></character> were not afraid to see <character reg="Willens">it</character> drowned. But all <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">they</character></character></character> got to see was that <object class="bodypart" type="male,death">arm</object> and <character reg="Willens">his</character> <object reg="WillensHand"><object class="bodypart" type="male,hand" keywords="death">pale hand</object></object>. <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">They</character></character></character> could see the <object reg="WillensHand"><object class="bodypart" type="male,hand" keywords="death">hand</object></object> quite plain once <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">they</character></character></character> got used to looking through the <object class="water" type="pond" keywords="hidden,evidence">water</object>. <object reg="WillensHand">It</object> rode there tremulously and irresolutely, like a <object reg="WillensHand"><object class="bodypart" type="animal">feather</object></object>, though <object reg="WillensHand">it</object> looked as solid as dough.
