What woke <character reg="Enid">Enid </character>up and kept <character reg="Enid">her</character> awake was a trouble of <character reg="Enid">her</character> own. <character reg="Enid">She</character> had begun to have ugly dreams. These were unlike any dreams <character reg="Enid">she</character> had ever had before. <character reg="Enid">She</character> used to think that a bad dream was one of finding <character reg="Enid">herself</character> in an unfamiliar house where the rooms kept changing and there was always more work to do than <character reg="Enid">she</character> could handle, work undone that <character reg="Enid">she</character> thought <character reg="Enid">she</character> had done, innumerable distractions.

It might be a stranger or a man <character reg="Enid">she</character> knew--sometimes a man whom it was quite a joke to think of in that way. These dreams made <character reg="Enid">her</character> thoughtful or a little sad but relieved in some way to know that such feelings were possible for <character reg="Enid">her</character>. They could be embarrassing, but were nothing, nothing at all compared with the dreams that <character reg="Enid">she</character> was having now. In the dreams that came to <character reg="Enid">her</character> now <character reg="Enid">she</character> would be copulating or trying to copulate (sometimes <character reg="Enid">she</character> was prevented by intruders or shifts of circumstances) with utterly forbidden and unthinkable partners. With fat squirmy babies or patients in bandages or <character reg="Enid">her</character> own <character reg="EnidMother">mother</character>. <character reg="Enid">She</character> would be slick with lust, hollow and groaning with it, and <character reg="Enid">she</character> would set to work with roughness and an attitude of evil pragmatism. &quot;Yes, this will have to do,&quot; <character reg="Enid">she</character> would say to <character reg="Enid">herself</character>. &quot;This will do if nothing better comes along.&quot; And this coldness of <object class="bodypart" type="female">heart</object>, this matter-of-fact depravity, simply drove <character reg="Enid">her</character> lust along. <character reg="Enid">She</character> woke up unrepentant, sweaty and exhausted, and lay like a <object class="body" type="dead">carcass</object> until <character reg="Enid">her</character> own <character reg="Enid">self</character>, <character reg="Enid">her</character> shame and disbelief, came pouring back into <character reg="Enid">her</character>.
