The <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">boys</character></character></character> squatted down on the bank, then lay on <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">their</character></character></character><object class="bodypart" type="male,child"> stomachs</object> and pushed <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">their</character></character></character> heads out like <object class="nature" type="animal" keywords="turtle">turtles</object>, trying to see. There was <character reg="Willens"><object class="bodypart" type="male" keywords="death,animal">something dark and furry</object></character>, <character reg="Willens"><object class="bodypart" type="male" keywords="death,animal">something like a big animal tail</object></character>, pushed up through the <object reg="WillensCar" type="part"><object class="window" type="open,sunroof">hole in the roof</object></object> and moving idly in the <object class="water" type="pond" keywords="death,hidden,evidence,secret">water</object>.

It seemed that inside the <object reg="WillensCar">car</object> a <object class="body" type="male,dead" keywords="evidence,hidden"><character reg="Willens">man's body</character></object>--it had to be the <object class="body" type="male,dead" keywords="evidence,hidden">body</object> of <character reg="Willens">Mr. Willens</character>--had got into a peculiar position.

The <object class="window" type="open">window</object> in fact must have been open and the <object class="bodypart" type="male">head</object> sticking out for the <object class="body" type="male,dead">body</object> to be lodged in that position.

This was a <object class="bodypart" type="male">face</object> already grotesque to <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">them</character></character></character>, in the way that many <object class="bodypart" type="male,female">adult faces</object> were, and <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">they</character></character></character> were not afraid to see <character reg="Willens">it</character> drowned. But all <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">they</character></character></character> got to see was that <object class="bodypart" type="male,death">arm</object> and <character reg="Willens">his</character> <object reg="WillensHand"><object class="bodypart" type="male,hand" keywords="death">pale hand</object></object>. <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">They</character></character></character> could see the <object reg="WillensHand"><object class="bodypart" type="male,hand" keywords="death">hand</object></object> quite plain once <character reg="CeceFerns"><character reg="BudSalter"><character reg="JimmyBox">they</character></character></character> got used to looking through the <object class="water" type="pond" keywords="hidden,evidence">water</object>. <object reg="WillensHand">It</object> rode there tremulously and irresolutely, like a <object reg="WillensHand"><object class="bodypart" type="animal">feather</object></object>, though <object reg="WillensHand">it</object> looked as solid as dough.

What woke <character reg="Enid">Enid </character>up and kept <character reg="Enid">her</character> awake was a trouble of <character reg="Enid">her</character> own. <character reg="Enid">She</character> had begun to have ugly dreams. These were unlike any dreams <character reg="Enid">she</character> had ever had before. <character reg="Enid">She</character> used to think that a bad dream was one of finding <character reg="Enid">herself</character> in an unfamiliar house where the rooms kept changing and there was always more work to do than <character reg="Enid">she</character> could handle, work undone that <character reg="Enid">she</character> thought <character reg="Enid">she</character> had done, innumerable distractions.

It might be a stranger or a man <character reg="Enid">she</character> knew--sometimes a man whom it was quite a joke to think of in that way. These dreams made <character reg="Enid">her</character> thoughtful or a little sad but relieved in some way to know that such feelings were possible for <character reg="Enid">her</character>. They could be embarrassing, but were nothing, nothing at all compared with the dreams that <character reg="Enid">she</character> was having now. In the dreams that came to <character reg="Enid">her</character> now <character reg="Enid">she</character> would be copulating or trying to copulate (sometimes <character reg="Enid">she</character> was prevented by intruders or shifts of circumstances) with utterly forbidden and unthinkable partners. With fat squirmy babies or patients in bandages or <character reg="Enid">her</character> own <character reg="EnidMother">mother</character>. <character reg="Enid">She</character> would be slick with lust, hollow and groaning with it, and <character reg="Enid">she</character> would set to work with roughness and an attitude of evil pragmatism. "Yes, this will have to do," <character reg="Enid">she</character> would say to <character reg="Enid">herself</character>. "This will do if nothing better comes along." And this coldness of <object class="bodypart" type="female">heart</object>, this matter-of-fact depravity, simply drove <character reg="Enid">her</character> lust along. <character reg="Enid">She</character> woke up unrepentant, sweaty and exhausted, and lay like a <object class="body" type="dead">carcass</object> until <character reg="Enid">her</character> own <character reg="Enid">self</character>, <character reg="Enid">her</character> shame and disbelief, came pouring back into <character reg="Enid">her</character>. The <object class="bodypart" type="excretion">sweat</object> went cold on <character reg="Enid">her</character><object class="bodypart" type="female"> skin</object>. <character reg="Enid">She</character> lay there shivering in the warm night, with disgust and humiliation. <character reg="Enid">She</character> did not dare go back to sleep. <character reg="Enid">She</character> got used to the <object class="dark">dark</object> and the long rectangles of the net-curtained <object class="window">windows</object> filled with a faint <object class="light">light</object>.
